st.markdown('[LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/en/) is based on the idea that the best way to learn a language, is through *comprehensible input*. Rather than traditional language learning methods, users [acquire the language](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html) by listening and reading to real world content that interests them. In my simplified version, users can improve their target-language comprehension with youtube videos that interest them. Learn more about language learning with [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/en/)')
